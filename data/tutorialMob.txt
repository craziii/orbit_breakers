How to play

Your goal is to use the ball to destroy all the blocks on screen.

Use your finger to move the paddle around a circle on screen. 
Keep the ball inside the level and destroy all blocks using the paddle.

You may rotate the paddle by using two fingers to direct which way it faces.

When a powerup spawns (Yellow Block), you can collect it with your paddle, 
this will provide a second paddle to help you keep the ball in the level.
