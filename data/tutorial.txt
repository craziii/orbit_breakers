How to play

Your goal is to use the ball to destroy all the blocks on screen.

Use your mouse to move the paddle around a circle on screen. 
Keep the ball inside the level and destroy all blocks using the paddle.

When a powerup spawns (Yellow Block), you can collect it with your paddle, 
this will provide a second paddle to help you keep the ball in the level.
