Your goal is to use the ball to destroy all the blocks on screen.

Use your mouse to move the paddle around a circle on screen. 
Keep the ball inside the level and destroy all blocks using the paddle.

Click the mouse to stop the paddle and aim it to control the ball.

When a powerup spawns (Yellow Blocks), you can collect it with your paddle, 
this will give you a powerup that will help you to win the game!

When you run out of lives, you will lose the game.
