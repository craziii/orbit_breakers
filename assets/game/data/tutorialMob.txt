Your goal is to use the ball to destroy all the blocks on screen.

Use your finger to move the paddle around a circle on screen. 
Keep the ball inside the level and destroy all blocks using the paddle.

You may rotate the paddle by using two fingers to direct which way it faces
and aim the ball.

When a powerup spawns (Yellow Block), you can collect it with your paddle, 
this will give you a powerup to help you win the game!

When you run out of lives, you will lose the game.
